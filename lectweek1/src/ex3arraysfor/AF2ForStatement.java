/*
    To repeat a number of statements we may use the
    for statement (also an iteration, a loop like while)

    while vs for - loops
    - while: Used when we don't know the number of iterations
    - for: Used when we DO KNOW the number of iterations.

    NOTE: We always put the statements to repeat in a block
    even if there is only one statement to repeat.

    NOTE: Placement of { , first (opening) on same line
